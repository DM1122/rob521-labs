# Lab 2 Report

## Part A: Simulation

1. See the following figure demonstrating successful output from RRT (Daye)

2. See the following figure illustrating successful output from RRT* (Davin)


3. See `trajectory-rollout-sim.mp4` for footage demonstrating a successful run of the trajectory rollout using RRT. (David)

4. Algorithm descriptions (Daye + Davin)


## Part B: Real Environment Deployment

1. See `trajectory-rollout.mp4` for footage of the robot conducting trajectory rollout using RRT in the new Myhal map.
