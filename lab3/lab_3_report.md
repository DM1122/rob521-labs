# Lab 3 Report


## Task 1: Vehicle Calibration (David)
• Design the experiments. How would you drive a robot using teleoperation to deter-
mined the parameters?

## Task 4 (David)

In your report, describe your experiments. Your summary must address these
points:
• What path the robot was driven in each experiment. (1 pt total)
– (0.5 pts) How did you drive the robot to determine the wheel radius? How much
did it rotate? How far did you drive forward?
– (0.5 pts) How did you drive the robot to determine the wheel separation? How
much did you rotate? How far did you drive forward?
• How does your code work or should work? How are the parameters determined? (0.5
pt total)
• What values did you get for the wheel radius and baseline? (0.5 pt total)
• Does these values match those given in the data sheet? Identify one possible source
of uncertainty or bias that made your answer differ from the factory calibration. (1
pt total)
– Identify the source of uncertainty or bias.
– How does the source of uncertainty or bias affect your measurement?
– How could you mitigate this source of uncertainty or bias?
