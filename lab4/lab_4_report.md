# ROB521 Lab 4 Report


## Part 1: turtlebot3_world localization
– present a picture of the AMCL rviz window with a converged filter.
– what was the minimum number of particles for successful localization? Are
your results repeatable (i.e if you give the robot a new initial pose estimate does
the particle filter converge)?
– what were the maximum odom_alpha parameters before localization failed?
